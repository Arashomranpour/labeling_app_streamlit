# Labeling App with Streamlit

This project implements a simple and interactive labeling app using Streamlit. The app allows users to label datasets in an intuitive, web-based interface. Itâ€™s ideal for tasks such as data annotation, categorization, and labeling for machine learning projects.

## Features

- **User-friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit to provide an easy-to-use interface for labeling tasks.
- **Dataset Loading**: Allows users to load datasets for labeling directly through the app.
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatically updates labels as users interact with the interface.
- **Flexible Usage**: Can be adapted to various labeling tasks such as classification, tagging, or annotation.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: The main Streamlit app file that handles the UI and labeling logic.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required to run the app.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.

## Installation and Setup

To set up and run this app locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Arashomranpour/labeling_app_streamlit.git
    cd labeling_app_streamlit
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Streamlit app**:
    Start the app with the following command:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- `streamlit`: Framework for building interactive web apps.
- Any additional libraries required for dataset manipulation (if needed).

## Usage

Once the app is running, users can:
- Load datasets for labeling through the app interface.
- Label data interactively using the provided UI.
- Export labeled datasets for further processing or model training.

## Future Enhancements

- **Enhanced Dataset Support**: Add support for more file formats and dataset types.
- **Multi-user Functionality**: Allow multiple users to label datasets simultaneously.
- **Customizable Labels**: Enable users to define and modify label sets directly within the app.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository, submit issues, or create pull requests to help enhance the app.
